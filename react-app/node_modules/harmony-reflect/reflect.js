 // This file is a polyfill for the upcoming ECMAScript Reflect API,
 // including support for Proxies. See the draft specification at:
 // http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:reflect_api
 // http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:direct_proxies

 // For an implementation of the Handler API, see handlers.js, which implements:
 // http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:virtual_object_api

 // This implementation supersedes the earlier polyfill at:
 // code.google.com/p/es-lab/source/browse/trunk/src/proxies/DirectProxies.js

 // This code was tested on tracemonkey / Firefox 12
//  (and should run fine on older Firefox versions starting with FF4)
 // The code also works correctly on
 //   v8 --harmony_proxies --harmony_weakmaps (v3.6.5.1)

 // Language Dependencies:
 //  - ECMAScript 5/strict
 //  - "old" (i.e. non-direct) Harmony Proxies
 //  - Harmony WeakMaps
 // Patches:
 //  - Object.{freeze,seal,preventEx
